<h3 id="General Idea">General Idea</h3>
The idea behind the method of moments is that for all $r$, the $E[X^r]$ for the sample should approximately equal the $E[X^r]$ for the population. Assuming this is true, we can set these two equations equal to estimate parameter values.
<h3 id="Example #1: Lottery-Tickets">Example #1: Lottery-Tickets</h3>
Using our lottery-ticket example, we are trying to estimate $b$, the number on the highest ticket. Because we are only estimating for one parameter, we only need on equation (one variable can be solved for with on equation). Thus, we only need to consider the case where $r=1$.
<br><br>
Because we are assuming that $E[X]$ should be approximatley the same for the population and the sample, we can set them equal and simply solve for $b$. For a uniform distribution, the expected value of $X$ is simply $\frac{a+b}{2}$. In this case, $a=1$, so $E[X]=\frac{1+b}{2}$. The expected value of our dataset is simply its average: 117.5. Setting these equal, we get
$$\frac{1+b}{2}=117.5$$
Solving this yields
$$b=234$$
So our estimate for $b$ is 234.
<h3 id="Example #2: Uniform Continuous">Example #2: Uniform Continuous</h3>
Again, we are only estimating one paramter, so we only need to consider $r=1$. For the distribution, we get

$$E\left[X\right]=\frac{b}{2}$$

The expected value of our dataset set is simply its average: $\bar{x}$. Setting these equal yields:

$$\frac{b}{2}=\bar{x}$$

which implies

$$b=2\bar{x}$$

In English, our estimate for $b$ is simply double the sample mean.
