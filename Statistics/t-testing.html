<h1>T-Testing</h1>
It might be a good idea to review <a href="Probability Distributions">Probability Distributions</a> and <a href="Types of Distributions.html">Types of Distributions</a> before continuing.
<h3>General Idea</h3>
With sufficiently large samples, the central limit theorem states that the means of these samples will follow a normal distribution with
$$\mu = \mu_{pop}$$
$$\sigma = \frac{\sigma_{pop}}{\sqrt{n}}$$
<h3>Example: One Population</h3>
Your friend says that the average male height is 6' (72") even. You take a sample of 100 random men and find a mean of 5'10" (70") and a standard deviation of 3". What are the odds of this distribution or something more extreme, given that your friend is telling the truth (the null-hypothesis)? We will use a two-tailed test.
<br><br>
Assuming null-hypothesis, the distribution of sample means should follow a normal distribution with
$$\mu = \mu_{pop} = 70$$
$$\sigma = \frac{\sigma_{pop}}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{100}} = 0.3$$
<br><br>
This particular sigma is known as the <b>standard error</b>. Thus, the z-score of your sample is
$$\frac{70-72}{0.3} \approx 6.67$$
<br><br>
However, it turns out we can't use a z-score with a normal distribution to calculate a p-value. Ther reason for this is that the null-hypothesis makes no claim about the population's standard deviation - we infer that from the data. Because of this, we must us a slighty modified distribution: the t-distribution.
<br><br>
The t-distribution has degrees of freedom equal to the sample size minus the number of parameters estimated (in this case $\sigma$). Thus, we have 99 degrees of freedom. Fortunately, our test-statistic is calculated just like our z-score, but is called a <b>t-score</b>.
<br><br>
Pluging this into R (doubling because our test is two-tailed):
<p>2*dt(6.67, 99)</p>
yields a p-value of 6.95e-9. Thus, we can reject the null-hypothesis and conclude that this is evidence that your friend is wrong and that the mean height of men is not 6'.
<br><br>
<h3>Generalization</h3>
Using some probability theory, we can generalize this method to test hypotheses that make claims about the difference in two different populations.
<h3>Example: Two Populations</h3>
Your friend, embarrased by his earlier claim now claims that the difference in heights between the average heighst of men and women is 6 inches. So, we sample 30 men and 40 women and find that the mean have a mean height of 5'10" (70") with a standard deviation of 3", while the women have a mean height of 5'5" (65") with a standard deviation of 2.5". The formula for computing the standard error in this case is:
$$SE=\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}+\frac{s_1^2}{n_2}}=\sqrt{\frac{3^2}{30}+\frac{2.5^2}{40}} \approx 0.675$$
The mean difference between our samples is 5". We can now compute the test statistic:
$$t=\frac{5-6}{0.675} \approx -1.48$$
The degrees of freedom of this t-test can be approximated by taking samller sample size and subtracting 1 (the exact calculation is complex). Thus, we have about 29 degrees of freedom. Plugging this into R:
<p>2*dt(-1.48, 29)</p>
yields a p-value of 0.265. This does not allow us to reject the null-hypothesis.
<h3>Assumptions</h3>
The central limit theorem states that as sample sizes go to infinity, the sample means approaches a normal distribution. In practice, it is generally fine to assume that the sample means follow a normal distribution when $n>30$.
