<h3 id="General Idea">General Idea</h3>
I have a fair coin. I flip it 3 times. How many times will heads be flipped? The expected number of heads is 1.5. After all, half the time a coin is flipped, it lands heads, and half of 3 is 1.5. However, in reality, we can only have an integer number of heads, so we will probably see 1 or 2 heads. However, there is also the chance that all 3 flips will be heads and that none of the flips will be heads.
<br><br>
To figure out how likely all of these scenarios are we can use a pretty simple method: just consider all the possibilities:
<table>
<tr><td><b>#</b></td><td><b>Sequence</b></td><td><b># of Heads</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>1.</td><td>TTT</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.</td><td>TTH</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>3.</td><td>THT</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>4.</td><td>THH</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>5.</td><td>HTT</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>6.</td><td>HTH</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>7.</td><td>HHT</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>8.</td><td>HHH</td><td>3</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
We can summarize this with the statistic we care about: the number of heads in the sample.
<br><br>
<table>
<tr><td><b># of Heads</b></td><td><b># of Sequences</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
It's important to note here that each of these sequences is equally likely. Because of this we can determine how likely each possible number-of-heads is to occur:
<br><br>
<table>
<tr><td><b># of Heads</b></td><td><b>Probability</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>$\frac{1}{8}=0.125$</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>$\frac{3}{8}=0.375$</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>$\frac{3}{8}=0.375$</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>$\frac{1}{8}=0.125$</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
This is called a <b>sampling distribution</b>. It represents how likely a statistic is to take on certain values given some sample-size (in this case, 3) and some model (in this case, that the coin if fair).

<h3 id="Example: Maximum of the Uniform">Example: Maximum of the Uniform</h3>
Let's say we have a continuous uniform distribution from 0 to $b$ What is the sampling distribution for the maximum of the sample for some sample-size, $n$?

$$P\left(m \leq max\left(\{X_1,...,X_n\}\right)\right)$$

by independence, this is equal to

$$P\left(m \leq X_1\right) \cdots P\left(m \leq X_n\right)$$

by plugging in the cdf for the uniform distribution, we get

$$\frac{m}{b} \cdots \frac{m}{b}, m \leq b$$

which just equals

$$\frac{m^n}{b^n}, m \leq b$$

Thus, the cdf for the sampling distribution of the maximum is:

$$P\left(m \leq max\left(\{X_1,...,X_n\}\right)\right) = \frac{m^n}{b^n}, m \leq b$$

Taking the derivative gives us the pdf:

$$f(m)=\frac{nm^{n-1}}{b^n}, m \leq b$$


<h3 id="Normal Distributions: Mean">Normal Distributions: Mean</h3>
Let's say we take an infinite number of $n$-size samples from a normal distribution with some $\mu$ and some $\sigma$. It turns out that the distribution of the sample means will also be normal with $\mu'=\mu$ and $\sigma'=\frac{\sigma}{n}$.
<br><br>
Notice, that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution get's smaller as the sample-size ($n$) gets bigger.
<h3 id="Normal Distributions: Standard Deviation">Normal Distributions: Standard Deviation</h3>
It turns out that $\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma^2}$ follows a a chi-squared distirbution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom:

$$\chi^2_{n-1}$$
