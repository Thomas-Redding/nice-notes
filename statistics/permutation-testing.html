<h1>Permutation Testing</h1>
<h3>General Ideas</h3>
In "<a href="Hypothesis Testing.html">one-sample hypothesis testing</a>, we sampled one population and tried to determine whether our sample was reasonable given that some paramter had a particular value. In <b>two-sample hypothesis testing</b>, we try to determine how likely our sample is given that two populations have an equal (but ungiven) parameter.
<h3>Example</h3>
You sample the heights of 2 men and 3 women and you want to test the null-hypothesis that height is independent of sex. The heights (in inches) are:
<p>Men = {68, 73}
<br>
Women = {61, 63, 71}</p>
The idea behind the permutation test is that if H<sub>0</sub> is correct, then every permutation of the data is equally likely. So, to compute the p-value, we figure out how likely we were to get a p-value more extreme than what we observed given H<sub>0</sub> is true. In this case, we will use the difference in the observed means to measure extremeness. There are 10 permutations:
<table border=1>
<tr><th>Men</th><th>Mean</th><th>Women</th><th>Mean</th><th>diff</th></tr>
<tr><td>71, 73</td><td>72.0</td><td>61, 63, 68</td><td>64.0</td><td>8.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>68, 73</td><td>70.5</td><td>61, 63, 71</td><td>65.0</td><td>5.5</td></tr>
<tr><td>63, 73</td><td>68.0</td><td>61, 68, 71</td><td>63.3</td><td>4.7</td></tr>
<tr><td>61, 73</td><td>67.0</td><td>63, 68, 71</td><td>6.3</td><td>-0.3</td></tr>
<tr><td>68, 71</td><td>69.5</td><td>61, 63, 73</td><td>65.7</td><td>3.8</td></tr>
<tr><td>63, 71</td><td>67.0</td><td>61, 68, 73</td><td>67.3</td><td>-0.3</td></tr>
<tr><td>61, 71</td><td>66.0</td><td>63, 68, 73</td><td>68.0</td><td>-2.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>63, 68</td><td>65.5</td><td>61, 71, 73</td><td>68.3</td><td>-2.8</td></tr>
<tr><td>61, 68</td><td>64.5</td><td>63, 71, 73</td><td>69.0</td><td>-4.5</td></tr>
<tr><td>61, 63</td><td>62.0</td><td>68, 71, 73</td><td>70.7</td><td>-8.7</td></tr>
</table>
Note, that for the obsered data, the difference in the means is

$$\frac{68+73}{2}-\frac{61+63+71}{3}=70.5-65=5.5$$

From the table, we can see that there 2 of the 10 permutations are equal or more extreme than the observed data. Thus our p-vaue = 2/10 = 0.2. Because this is greater than our significance threshould of 0.05, we can reject the null-hypothesis.
<h3>Generalization</h3>
<b>Two Sides:</b><br>
Note, that the example above is for a one-sided test. You can also compute two-sided permutaiton test. In this case, you have two choices, depending on how you interpret "extreme":
<ol>
<li>You could look at 5.5 and decide that something is more extreme on the negative side if it is smaller than -5.5. Thus, you would include -8.7. This would increase your p-value to 0.3.</li>
<li>You could look at 0.2 and decide that something is more extreme on the negative side if it is beyond the 20th percentile. In this case, you would simply double your estimated p-value: 0.4.</li>
</ol>
<br><br>
<b>Large Samples:</b><br>
Sometimes, your samples are too large to feasibly compute an actual permutation test. In this case, you can use a computer to simulate a large number ($n$) permutations and count the number of times ($t$) the test statistic was equal to or more extreme than the observed values. The estimatd p-value is given by:
$$p=\frac{t+1}{n+1}$$
We add a 1 to the numerator and denominator to represent that observation itself, which (via H<sub>0</sub>) is assumed to be generated the same way. Strictly speaking, you should give a confidence interval for this p-value via the binomial distribution, but with sufficiently large $n$'s, this becomes irrelevant.
<br><br>
<b>Test Statistic:</b><br>
We didn't have to use the mean in the example above, we could have used any test statistic such as a trimmed mean or median. We could even have used the standard deviation, if we were trying to test the hypothesis "men and women have the same standard deviation in height."
<h3>Assumptions</h3>
Permutation testing takes as its null-hypothesis that any observation in group A and any observation in group B could just as likely have been in the other group. In particular, this gets a little tricky if you really only care about a part of your null-hypothesis.
<br><br>
More specifically, the null-hypothesis for the permutation test is really that the distributions of both populations are identical. However, sometimes you only really care whether their means (or other centers) are the same. It turns out that this only really becomes a problem if the two sample sizes are significantly different.
