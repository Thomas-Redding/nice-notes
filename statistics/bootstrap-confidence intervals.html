<h1>Bootstrapping</h1>
<h3>General Ideas</h3>
Before we discuss bootstrapping, we need to make our goal clear. Imagine if we took a large number of samples from a population and recorded each sample's mean. Because samples aren't perfect representations of their population, there would be some variance in these means. This set of means is called the <b>sampling distribution of means</b>:

Now, if we only took one sample of the population, it would be really useful to know the shape and spread of the sampling distribution of means. That way, we could determine roughly how close the population's true mean is from our sample's mean.
<br><br>
Now the question: how could we go about estimating the sampling distribution of means using only one sample? More or less, our gameplan is to
<ol>
<li>Take our random sample</li>
<li>Use this sample to guess at the population's distribution</li>
<li>Use this guess to estimate for the sampling distribution of means</li>
</ol>
