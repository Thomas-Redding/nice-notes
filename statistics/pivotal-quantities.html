<h3 id="General Idea">General Idea</h3>
A pivotal statistic is a statistic that doesn't depend on a paremter's value. For instance, with a normal distribution, $\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$ is a pivotal statistic if $\mu$ is the unknown parameter we are trying to find, because its distribution doesn't depend on $\mu$'s value. No matter what $\mu$ turns out to be, $\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$ will have a standard normal distribution. We take advantage of this fact in <a href="Numeric Variables.html#Quantile Plots">QQ-Plots</a>.
<h3 id="Example #1: Exponential">Example #1: Exponential</h3>
Pivotal statistics are important, because they help us find confidence intervals. For instance, let $X$ be a number generated by an exponential distribution with some unknown $\lambda$. Let $Y=\lambda X$. This makes $Y$ a pivotal statistic, because no matter what $\lambda$ is, $Y$ will follow a standard exponential distribution (i.e. $\lambda=1$).
<br><br>
<b>Proof</b>
<br>
We will prove that $Y=\lambda X$ is a pivotal statistic for a exponential distribution. Let $X$ come from an exponential distribution with some unknown $\lambda$. In this case, we know the cumulative distribution function for $X$ is
$$F(x)=1-e^{-\lambda x}$$
We also know that $X=\frac{Y}{\lambda}$. Thus, the cumulative distribution function for $Y$ is
$$G(x)=1-e^{-\lambda \left(\frac{X}{\lambda}\right)}=1-e^{-X}$$
This is the standard exponential distribution.
<br><br>
<b>Application</b>
<br>
Let's say we want to find a 90% confidence interval for $\lambda$ from a sample of one: $X$. Because $Y$ is a pivotal statistic, we know it will follow a standard exponential distribution. Because we are using a 90% confidence interval, we know we will reject if it is in the lower or upper 5% of this distribution.

<br>
Algebraically, we can solve for this by using the cumulative distribution function for an exponential function: $1-e^{-x}$

<table cellpadding="10px">
<tr><td>$0.95=1-e^{-q_2}$</td><td>$0.05=1-e^{-q_1}$</td></tr>
<tr><td>$q_2=2.996$</td><td>$q_1=0.051$</td></tr>
</table>

Because this was based on the distribution of $P$, we can interpret this result as "We are 90% confident that the true value of $Y$ is between 0.051 and 2.996."

$$0.90=P\left(0.051 \lt Y \lt 2.996\right)$$

Recall that $Y=\lambda X$, thus:

$$0.90=P\left(0.051 \lt \lambda X \lt 2.996\right)$$
$$0.90=P\left(\frac{0.051}{X} \lt \lambda \lt \frac{2.996}{X}\right)$$

Where $X$ is whatever our sample of one is.

<h3 id="Example #2: Normal">Example #2: Normal</h3>

As mentioned before, $\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}$ is a pivotal statistic. It turns out that $\frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}$ is also a pivotal statistic, where $\bar{X}$ is the mean of a sample, $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$. We will call this statistic $Y$. It also turns out that $Y$ follows a standard normal distribution.
<img src="Normal CI.png" style="max-width:400px">
We can solve for $q_1$ and $q_2$ by using the inverse normal function to get $q_1=-1.959964$ and $q_2=1.959964$. This means that "we are 95% confident that $Y$ is between -1.96 and 1.96." In other words:
$$0.95=P\left(-1.96 \lt Y \lt 1.96\right)$$
Recall that $Y=\frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}$
$$0.95=P\left(-1.96 \lt \frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} \lt 1.96\right)$$
$$0.95=P\left(-1.96\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \lt \bar{X}-\mu \lt 1.96\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$$
$$0.95=P\left(-\bar{X}-1.96\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \lt -\mu \lt -\bar{X}+1.96\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$$
$$0.95=P\left(\bar{X}+1.96\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \gt \mu \gt \bar{X}-1.96\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$$

<b>Concrete Example</b>
<br>
Let's imagine that we know that $\sigma=5$, and that our sample has $\bar{X}=11$ and a size of 17.

$$0.95=P\left(11+1.96\frac{5}{\sqrt{17}} \gt \mu \gt 11-1.96\frac{5}{\sqrt{17}}\right)$$
$$0.95=P\left(13.377 \gt \mu \gt 8.623\right)$$
We can interpret this as "we are 95% confident that the true value of $\mu$ lies between 8.62 and 13.4."

<h3 id="Example #3: Uniforms">Example #3: Uniforms</h3>
For some uniform distribution with minimum 0 and maximum $\theta$, $Y=\frac{max(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)}{\theta}$ is a pivotal statistic
<br><br>
<b>Proof</b>
<br>
For a uniform distribution:
$$F(x)=\frac{x}{\theta}$$
The maximum of a sample of $n$ is given by:
$$P(max(X_1,X_2,...,X_n) \lt x)=P(X_1 \lt x, X_2 \lt x, ..., X_n \lt x)$$
By independence, this becomes
$$P(X \lt x)^n=F(x)^n={\left(\frac{x}{\theta}\right)}^n=\frac{x^n}{\theta^n}$$
In short,
$$P\left(max(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n) \lt x\right) = \frac{x^n}{\theta^n}$$
This means that the $max(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)$ follows the above distribution. Now, we also know that
$$Y=\frac{max(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)}{\theta}$$
$$Y\theta=max(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)$$
By substitution, we get
$$P\left(Y\theta \lt y\theta\right) = \frac{\left(y\theta\right)^n}{\theta^n}$$
$$P\left(Y\theta \lt y\theta\right) = y^n$$
$$P\left(Y \lt y\right) = y^n$$
This is independent of $\theta$, so $Y$ is a pivotal statistic.
<br><br>
<b>Application</b>
<br>
Let's say we take a sample of size $n$ and of maximum $M$, and we want to determine a 95% confidence interval. We know that $Y=\frac{M}{\theta}$ has a cumulative distribution function of $y^n$ from 0 to 1. Thus, we can solve for $q_1$ and $q_2$.
<br><br>
$${q_2}^n=0.975$$
$$q_2=0.975^{\frac{1}{n}}$$
and
$${q_1}^n=0.025$$
$$q_1=0.025^{\frac{1}{n}}$$
We also know that
$$0.95=P\left(q_1 \lt Y \lt q_2 \right)$$
By substitution,
$$0.95=P\left(0.025^{\frac{1}{n}} \lt \frac{M}{\theta} \lt 0.975^{\frac{1}{n}} \right)$$
$$0.95=P\left(\frac{M}{0.025^{\frac{1}{n}}} \gt \theta \gt \frac{M}{0.975^{\frac{1}{n}}} \right)$$
This gives us our confidence interval in terms of our sample's size and maximum. For instance, if we had a sample of 20 and the maximum observation was 1, we'd give a 95% confidence interval of $\left[1.001,1.203y\right]$. Note, both of these are higher than our maximum, because the maximum of the distribution must always be higher than (or equal to) the maximum of the sample.
