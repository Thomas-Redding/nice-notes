<h1>Bootstrap T</h1>
<h3>General Idea</h3>
We use <a href="Bootstrapping.html">bootstrapping</a> to get a feel for the distribution of the sample, and we use the t-statistic as our estimator. The reason behind using the t-statistic is that it improves our bootstrap distribution in the case of a skewed population. Basically, let's say our population is skewed right. If the observations in our sample are generally larger than the population, then there is a good chance that our sample exhibits higher variance than our population, because of the thick tail. We try to account for this by looking at the t-statistic of our resamples generated by bootstrapping instead of just looking at the means.
<h3>Example</h3>
Let's say we sample $n$ of a company's lightbulbs to see how long they last before going out, and we want to compute a 95% confidence interval for the average lifespan of the lightbulbs. For each lightbulb we have a lifespan, $X_i$. These lightbulbs come from some unknown population distribution, $F$. We extrapolate (using bootstrapping) from our sample to a pseudo-population and take a large number of $n$-sized samples. For each sample, we can compute a t-statistic:
$$T^*=\frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$$
$T^*$ follows a sampling distribution, $G$. We can approximate $G$ by using bootstrapping. Using this bootstraped distribution, we can estimate the quantile values of 0.975 and 0.025.

It thus follows that
$$0.95=P\left(q_1 \lt T^* \lt q_2 \right)$$
$$0.95=P\left(q_1 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \lt \bar{X}-\mu \lt q_2 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \right)$$
$$0.95=P\left(\bar{X} - q_1 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \gt \mu \gt \bar{X} - q_2 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \right)$$
Then, based on your actual data and bootstrap results, you can plug in the numbers and compute a 95% confidence interval. Note, that when $\alpha$ is reasonably close to 0, then $q_1$ is negative and $q_2$ is positive.
