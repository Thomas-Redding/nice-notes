<h1>Eigenvectors</h1>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<div class="definition">
    An <em>eigenvector</em> is a nonzero vector $\vec{v}$ such that there exists a number $\lambda$ so that $A \vec{v} = \lambda \vec{v}$. The $\lambda$ is known as an <em>eigenvalue</em>, and together they form an <em>eigenpair</em>.
</div>
<p>
	    An eigenvector of a linear transformation $A$ is a vector whose direction doesn't change when a transformation is applied.  What may change is its magnitude, which is scaled by the eigenvector's corresponding eigenvalue.
</p>

<h2>As A Basis</h2>
<p>
	Consider some $n \times n$ matrix $A$.  We can find its $n$ eigenvectors/value pairs and create two matrices: a $n \times n$ matrix $V$ whose columns are the eigenvectors, and a $n \times n$ matrix $D$ that is diagonal, with each entry on the diagonal being an eigenvalue:

	\[ V = \begin{bmatrix}
	\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
    \vec{v_1}  & \vec{v_2} & \dots & \vec{v_n} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots
	\end{bmatrix}

	D = \begin{bmatrix}
	\lambda_1 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
    0 & \lambda_2 & \dots  & 0 \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & 0\\
    0 & 0 & \dots & \lambda_n \\
	\end{bmatrix}
	\]

	Because $A\vec{v_1} = \vec{v_1}\lambda_1$, we know $AV = VD$, which can be used to derive the following identity:

	\[ A = VDV^{-1} \]

	This way of decomposing a matrix into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues helps to capture the relationship between the two.  When you apply $A$ to a vector $x$, what you're "really" doing is

	\[ Ax = VDV^{-1}x \]

	Which is intuitively
	<ol>
		<li>Convert from the original basis to the basis formed from the eigenvectors</li>
		<li>Scale the point in the eigenvector basis</li>
		<li>Convert back into the original coordinate system</li>
	</ol>

</p>

<h2>Iteration</h2>
<p>
	As a result of this change-of-basis-and-scale behavior, eigenvectors capture the long term behavior of applying a linear transformation repeatedly.  In other words, $AAA...AA\vec{v}$ will converge onto some eigenvector of $A$.

<p>
Below is a demo that lets you choose any (real) eigenvector and any (positive) eigenvalue and see what the resulting linear transformation is.  Here are some things to notice:
<ul>
	<li>The image of a unit circle is an ellipse centered at (0, 0)</li>
	<li>The area of the ellipse equals the product of the eigenvalues</li>
	<li>The vector with the bigger eigenvalue is the most important for determining how the image looks</li>
</ul>

<h3>Imaginary Eigenvectors</h3>
<p>
	This leads to a curious phenmenon where the eigenvector of a real matrix can be imaginary.  This means that $A^n \vec{v}$ is always real, so what does a complex eigenvector imply for its long-term behavior?

<p>
	The points spiral!  Depending on the exact eigenpair, the points my spiral inwards and converge on (0, 0) or diverge outwards to infinity (as shown above), but this spiraling behavior is consistent for imaginary-eigenvectored matrices.
